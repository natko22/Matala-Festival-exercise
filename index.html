<h5>Crete (Greek: Κρήτη, Modern: Kríti [ˈkɾiti], Ancient: Krḗtē [krɛ̌ːtεː]) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Corsica. Crete rests about 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland, and about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Anatolia. Crete has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi). It bounds the southern border of the Aegean Sea, with the Sea of Crete (or North Cretan Sea) to the north and the Libyan Sea (or South Cretan Sea) to the south.</h5>

        <h1>Matala Beach Festival</h1>
        <h5>A unique festival on the sandy beach beneath the caves made famous during the hippie era of the 1960s and 70s.
            Matala is a small town in Crete island which is glorious for its hippie history. In the 60s and 70s, this area belonged to hippie travellers who lived near the beachside and in the caves. The festival was founded in 2011 to keep the myth of Matala alive. Annually in mid-June, the event attracts lots of people from every corner of the earth. Famous Canadian singer Joni Mitchell used to visit this festival and was inspired to write a song about Matala called “Carey.”

When visiting the Matala Music Festival, you can enjoy very famous singers and bands, take part in lots of art events, dance, try some Greek spirits, and just feel some good old hippie vibes.
